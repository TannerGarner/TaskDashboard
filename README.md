# TaskDashboard

Based loosely on the mockup in the images folder, create a task management webpage. 

Key functionality: 
- Adding tasks to the Task Board. 
- Saving those tasks to local storage or a database for future use. 
    I do not currently know how to set up any sort of database, so this may be beyond the scope. 
- Moving tasks from column to column.
